		    <h4>Stuart is more than a calendar, it is the calendar !</h4>
		    <p>I had, for a long time, used different calendars in my life. But I always had many problems "It's too long", "I can't really see what appointment I have in my day !", "Gasp !"</br> Then one day, I told myself : " Why didn't I create my own calendar ? " </br> Then this project came thrue ! </br></br> But in fact, it's cool to have my calendar but it's better if anyone can use and enjoy it ?</p>
